                No Tanks Left is a game I completed for a school project. The game is played by only using one button, which turns you right. The tanks will constantly move and shoot. The game can fit as many players as there are keys on a keyboard. I was responsible
                for coding and designing the game, and my partner helped create some of the art assets.</div>

                The Patient was a game I worked on with a close friend of mine. The goal of the game is to make your way through the depths of an abandon hospital and escape. However, you are not alone. I was reponsible for coding and my partner created the story and
                the map.

                keeping the most value items possible to make money. We got 5th place.
